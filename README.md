# Object-segmentation-using-Mask-RCNN
This is a simple implementation of Mask RCNN on Python 3, Keras and Tensorflow version 2. The model generates the bounding box and the segmentation mask for the input images with their coresponding confidence score. This code is forked from the official implementation of Mask RCNN by [matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)
